                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <div class="about-me-content">
                    <p class="about-me-desc" id="education">My journey through education has been quite the ride! from grappling physics concepts to trying to conjugate Spanish verbs (yo hablo espa√±ol muy bien, por supuesto), I thought I had seen it all. But then, I discovered the wonderful
                        world of <span>computer science</span> at the
                        <span>Technological University of Dublin</span> and boy, was I hooked! I learned all about the inner workings of machines, from data structures and algorithms to web development and software engineering. And let's not forget about
                        the thrilling rollercoaster ride that was <span>Object Oriented Programming</span> - who knew you could have so much fun with classes and objects? Of course, I learned about <span>computer
                            architecture</span> too, because what good is a shiny new program if it doesn't run smoothly on the hardware? All in all, my education has been a wild ride, but I wouldn't have it any other way!
                    </p>


                    <p class="about-me-desc" id="work-experience" style="display:none">
                        My work experience has been just as thrilling! I had the opportunity to work at Ocuclo where I honed my skills in <span>.NET</span>, <span>HTML</span>, <span>JS</span>, <span>jQuery</span>, and various APIs like
                        <span>AJAX</span> and <span>C#</span>. The work was challenging, but it pushed me to grow as a developer and to constantly learn new things. From developing user interfaces to designing databases and implementing complex functionality,
                        I was able to immerse myself in the world of web development and software engineering.
                    </p>


                    <p class="about-me-desc" id="technologies" style="display:none">
                        Software development has been quite an adventure! From learning the basics of programming languages such as <span>.NET</span>,
                        <span> Java</span>,
                        <span>C++ </span>,
                        <span>C</span>, <span>Python</span>, <span>PHP</span>, and more, to creating dynamic web applications using <span>HTML</span>, <span>JS</span>, <span>jQuery</span> and various API's such as <span>Ajax</span>, <span>RESTful</span>,
                        and more, my experience has been both challenging and rewarding. I've worked with different types of databases such as <span>SQL</span>, <span>PostgreSQL</span>, <span>MongoDB</span>, and more, managing them using tools like
                        <span>pgAdmin</span>. Each project has been a new opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm grateful for the chance to work with such a variety of technologies.
                    </p>


                    <p class="about-me-desc" id="skill-hobbies" style="display:none">
                        My skills and hobbies are diverse, but I'm particularly passionate about <span>front-end web
                            design</span> and <span>personal project development</span>. I enjoy challenging myself through <span>competitive coding on Google Kick Start</span> and staying healthy with regular visits to the <span>gym</span>. I also love
                        to explore new places and try different cuisines while traveling, as <span>food</span> is another one of my great passions.

                        "Working with <span>Habeeb</span> was an absolute pleasure. His <span>coding skills</span> are top-notch and he always went the extra mile to ensure the project was delivered on time. I would highly recommend him for any project
                        that requires <span>attention to detail</span> and a strong work ethic." <br>- Jane Doe, Project Manager "<br><br>

                        <span>Habeeb</span> is an exceptional <span>designer</span> with a keen eye for detail. Her work on our latest project was nothing short of amazing. She is also an excellent communicator, which made the entire process a breeze.
